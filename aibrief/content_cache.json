Synapse, similarly, will drive demand for specialized AGI hardware. By 2027, expect a $50 billion market for AGI-optimized processors and memory, benefiting companies like NVIDIA and potentially new entrants. The Economist rightly identifies hardware manufacturers as winners, but misses the sheer scale of the potential windfall, reminiscent of IBM's System/360 launch."

Synapse's potential $750 billion market by 2030 needs scrutiny. What percentage is real economic activity versus speculative investment?

The Price-Anderson Act limited the liability of nuclear power plant operators to encourage investment. A similar regulatory framework may be needed for AGI, but with careful consideration. The Economist's analysis needs to explore the potential for government intervention to manage the systemic risks associated with Synapse, including liability caps and mandatory safety standards. Without this, the $750 billion market may never materialize."

A coordinated attack exploiting a Synapse flaw could trigger a global economic crisis, leading to calls for a 'digital Geneva Convention.' However, the decentralized nature of AGI development will make enforcement challenging. OpenAI will face increasing pressure to open-source parts of its platform, but will resist, leading to antitrust litigation and potential government intervention. Expect a splinter group of OpenAI engineers to create a competing AGI platform, backed by venture capital and nation-states seeking to break OpenAI's dominance. The Historian's emphasis on fragmentation is valid, but it will be driven by strategic competition, not inherent limitations of Synapse's architecture.",
